# Pocketto-Rocketto
Pocketto Rocketto provides non-ads adult content on webview.
How is that possible; with some filter-list, request-block and cosmetic filters by selected, specialized for per website in the app.
Pocketto Rocketto blocks almost every request coming from ad-platform broadcast. This makes your adult video experience more flow and soft without ads.
Also provides offline bookmark options *realtime-database is just for check or block app version.* with realm-mongo technologies.

Unfortuanetly i can just show select screen of the app, but you can just check the all components by download app on your phone.. :)
